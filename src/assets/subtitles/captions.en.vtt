00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
What is OpenStudio?

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.828
OpenStudio is a free open-platform
software product developed by the…

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.130
…National Renewable Energy Laboratory
and the US Department of Energy.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.750
Buildings in the United States
consume 40% of our energy.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.082
OpenStudio's objective is to help building owners,
architects, designers, engineers, and others…

00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:28.140
…involved in the design process (people like you)
to design buildings that are more energy efficient.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.266
OpenStudio can be used by anyone involved in
the design, construction, or facility management…

00:00:35.278 --> 00:00:41.070
…industries: building owners, architects,
engineers, software developers, and researchers.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.611
OpenStudio has two distinct
components: the application…

00:00:46.623 --> 00:00:49.590
…suite, and the software
development platform.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.152
The primary users of the
application suite are the design team,

00:00:54.164 --> 00:00:58.560
including the architect, engineer,
building owner, and other consultants.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.816
The primary users of
the development platform…

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.200
…are software developers
and researchers.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.710
First, let's talk about
the application suite.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.270
So, design team, what do you want
to learn when using OpenStudio?

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.660
How much energy is
the design going to save?

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.970
How much will it cost me?

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.902
How does the OpenStudio
application suite…

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:24.600
…help the design team
answer these questions?

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.450
OpenStudio supports an iterative workflow
of design, simulation, and analysis.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.714
This allows for ongoing feedback about
the energy impact of decisions, along with…

00:01:35.726 --> 00:01:40.260
…other design factors, such as program
requirements, costs, and building codes.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.870
How about the developers and researchers?

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.670
What questions do you have regarding the
OpenStudio software development platform?

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.420
How do I develop in OpenStudio,
and why would I want to?

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.110
How do I optimize a building
design using OpenStudio?

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.920
How does the development
platform support these developers?

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.600
You can develop in C++, C#, or Ruby.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.050
You can develop on the
operating system of your choice.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.529
Both the OpenStudio development
platform as well as the application…

00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:15.300
…suite are cross-platform,
supporting Windows, Mac, and Linux.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.468
You can interface with
OpenStudio through the API,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.680
or you can work directly
in the C++ source code.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.370
OpenStudio has an
open-source LGPL license.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.276
You can produce and sell your own software,
or you can contribute code back to…

00:02:31.288 --> 00:02:35.700
…the OpenStudio community by merging
your work into the OpenStudio source code.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.670
So why does this help the developer?

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.171
It helps you because we have abstracted
out the general knowledge needed…

00:02:43.183 --> 00:02:46.830
…to create a building model by
providing a relational object model.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.700
Yes, OpenStudio can help researchers, too.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.575
You can access the advanced functions
you need through scripting, or you can…

00:02:55.587 --> 00:02:59.850
…quickly create a custom graphical
user interface specific to your research.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.510
Extensive documentation is
available online to assist you.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.632
One strength of the OpenStudio
software development platform…

00:03:07.644 --> 00:03:10.830
…is the speed and ease with
which you can develop new tools.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.170
Derived tools leverage the inherent power
of OpenStudio's object model and methods.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.185
So if the design team has needs outside
the scope of the application suite's…

00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:26.130
…tools, the developer simply creates a new
tool that supports the design team's use.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.240
In this case, the developer
creates an independent plugin.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.229
In another case, you may
choose to contribute the…

00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:35.670
…new functionality to
OpenStudio's source code.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.490
The design team has now expanded their
toolset to fit their unique requirements.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.083
So, we know OpenStudio's
goal is to save energy, but how…

00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:54.420
…does it impact the design
process to accomplish this?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.446
It enhances the speed and quality of user
workflows, facilitates better integration…

00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:06.180
…among team members, provides rapid feedback
on energy performance of design decisions.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.330
Save energy.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.530
Save money.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.660
Reduce your carbon footprint.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.380
OpenStudio.
