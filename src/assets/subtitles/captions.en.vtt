00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.920
What is OpenStudio?

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.280
OpenStudio is a free
open-platform software product

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.670
developed by the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory and

4
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.510
the US Department of Energy.
Buildings in the United States

5
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.220
consume 40% of our energy.
OpenStudio's objective is to

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.010
help building owners,
architects, designers,

7
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.820
engineers, and others involved
in the design process (people

8
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.120
like you) to design buildings
that are more energy efficient.

9
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.710
OpenStudio can be used by anyone
involved in the design,

10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.580
construction, or facility
management industries: building

11
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.330
owners, architects, engineers,
software developers, and

12
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.050
researchers.

13
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.790
OpenStudio has two distinct
components: the application

14
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.480
suite, and the software
development platform. The

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.110
primary users of the application
suite are the design team,

16
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.620
including the architect,
engineer, building owner, and

17
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.130
other consultants. The primary
users of the development

18
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.220
platform are software developers
and researchers.

19
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.040
First, let's talk about the
application suite. So, design

20
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.660
team, what do you want to learn
when using OpenStudio? How much

21
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.950
energy is the design going to
save? How much will it cost me?

22
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.540
How does the OpenStudio
application suite help the

23
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.610
design team answer these
questions?

24
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.490
OpenStudio supports an iterative
workflow of design, simulation,

25
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.150
and analysis. This allows for
ongoing feedback about the

26
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.630
energy impact of decisions,
along with other design factors,

27
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.260
such as program requirements,
costs, and building codes.

28
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.040
How about the developers and
researchers? What questions do

29
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.070
you have regarding the
OpenStudio software development

30
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.120
platform? How do I develop in
OpenStudio, and why would I want

31
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.920
to? How do I optimize a building
design using OpenStudio? How

32
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.920
does the development platform
support these developers?

33
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.260
You can develop in C++, C#, or
Ruby. You can develop on the

34
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.100
operating system of your choice.
Both the OpenStudio development

35
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.860
platform as well as the
application suite are

36
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.450
cross-platform, supporting
Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can

37
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.200
interface with OpenStudio
through the API, or you can work

38
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.030
directly in the C++ source code.
OpenStudio has an open-source

39
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.530
LGPL license. You can produce
and sell your own software, or

40
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.950
you can contribute code back to
the OpenStudio community by

41
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.710
merging your work into the
OpenStudio source code.

42
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.330
So why does this help the
developer? It helps you because

43
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.940
we have abstracted out the
general knowledge needed to

44
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.330
create a building model by
providing a relational object

45
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.970
model. Yes, OpenStudio can help
researchers, too. You can access

46
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.240
the advanced functions you need
through scripting, or you can

47
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.000
quickly create a custom
graphical user interface

48
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.930
specific to your research.
Extensive documentation is

49
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.520
available online to assist you.

50
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.870
One strength of the OpenStudio
software development platform is

51
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.810
the speed and ease with which
you can develop new tools.

52
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.710
Derived tools leverage the
inherent power of OpenStudio's

53
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.640
object model and methods. So if
the design team has needs

54
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.850
outside the scope of the
application suite's tools, the

55
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.240
developer simply creates a new
tool that supports the design

56
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.710
team's use. In this case, the
developer creates an independent

57
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.250
plugin. In another case, you may
choose to contribute the new

58
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.230
functionality to OpenStudio's
source code. The design team has

59
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.500
now expanded their toolset to
fit their unique requirements.

60
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.890
So, we know OpenStudio's goal is
to save energy, but how does it

61
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.330
impact the design process to
accomplish this? It enhances the

62
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.290
speed and quality of user
workflows, facilitates better

63
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.950
integration among team members,
provides rapid feedback on

64
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.170
energy performance of design
decisions.

65
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.690
Save energy. Save money. Reduce
your carbon footprint.
