  html: `NREL is working on a new BCL implementation.  The current BCL website will be deprecated. The new BCL replacement will use a set of GitHub repositories as the back-end for robustness, transparency and flexibility: version-controlled Measures, Components, and Weather Files.  NREL will migrate its current BCL content to a set of GitHub repositories and will provide instructions for organizations and groups with BCL content to do the same. The new BCL aims to preserve its API functionality (and syntax) and interface to existing DOE/NREL tools and to the OpenStudio Coalitionâ€™s OpenStudio Application. A minimal web interface will be provided.  Stay tuned for more information, launch date, and content migration instructions.`
