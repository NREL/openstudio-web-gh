  title: 'A Shift in BTO’s BEM Strategy: A New Future for the OpenStudio Application',
  time: '2018-09-06 15:22:04 -0600',
  html: `<p>Whole-building energy modeling (BEM) is a multi-purpose enabling technology for improving building energy performance.
        BEM supports energy-efficiency applications such as integrated design, code development and compliance, ratings, program design and administration, product design, and policy and investment analysis.
        The U.S. Department of Energy’s Building Technologies Office (BTO) has supported BEM research and development for decades and has itself been a significant consumer of BEM.
        A significant part of BTO’s strategy is funding and managing the development of BEM software.
        The focus has largely been on physics engines such as DOE-2 and EnergyPlus—where BTO has emphasized transparency, advanced capabilities, and accuracy—but BTO has developed some applications as well.
        One highly visible example is the OpenStudio Application, a graphical model editing environment that works in conjunction with the OpenStudio SketchUp plug-in.
        Together, these have been responsible for a significant increase in EnergyPlus adoption.</p>

        <div style="padding-top:40px;padding-bottom:40px;">
        <div style=" text-align:center;display: inline-block;">
        <img class="ossap" src="assets/images/osapp.png" width="43%" style="padding-right:30px;" /><img src="assets/images/sketchup.png" width="35%" /></div>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin:auto;padding-top:5px;"><strong>Screenshots of OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-In</strong></div></div>
        <br/>
        <p>Despite the success of the OpenStudio Application the most expedient and effective growth channel for BEM in general, and for open-source BEM tools in particular, is private-sector applications and services.
        <strong>After a year-long discussion with industry stakeholders, including the IBPSA-USA Advocacy Committee, BTO has decided to transition responsibility for management, development, distribution, and support of the OpenStudio Application to third parties by April 2020.</strong>
        This planned transition follows BTO’s previous move to de-emphasize and eventually phase-out the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in from its portfolio. BTO and the national labs will spend the next 18-plus months working to maximize the chances of a successful transition and to minimize disruption to existing OpenStudio Application users. </p>
        <div style="padding-top:40px;padding-bottom:40px;">

        <div style="text-align:center;margin:auto;padding-top:10px;"><strong>OpenStudio Application Transition Timeline</strong></div></div>
        <p>The OpenStudio Application and SketchUp Plug-in are small parts of the larger OpenStudio project. The project also includes a set of non-graphical components collectively referred to as the OpenStudio SDK (Software Development Kit).
        The SDK provides programmatic access to EnergyPlus inputs and outputs via the OpenStudio Model API (Application Programming Interface), support for scripting and workflow automation via OpenStudio Measures and the OpenStudio CLI (Command Line Interface), prototype building models via the OpenStudio Standards gem, and large-scale simulation on local, cluster, and cloud resources via OpenStudio Server.
        <strong>BTO plans to retain the OpenStudio SDK—along with the graphical Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT) and Floorspace.JS geometry widget—within its open-source BEM software portfolio. Additionally, the Building Component Library (BCL) will continue to be maintained as a publicly available repository for OpenStudio Measures and other content.
        </strong> These components and capabilities benefit BTO and its project and analysis portfolio; they benefit end-users via a growing number of third-party applications and services that build upon them. Going forward, BTO will focus on supporting these components and developers who wish to take advantage of them.</p>
        <p>BTO and the labs plan to engage stakeholders throughout this process to both provide updates and receive feedback. Questions, concerns, or comments about this plan can be sent to <a href="mailto:openstudio@nrel.gov?subject=OpenStudio%20Application%20Separation">openstudio@nrel.gov</a>.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <ul><li>Why is BTO making this transition?
        <ul style="padding-bottom:10px;"><li>The planned transition of the OpenStudio Application is BTO’s attempt to balance interests stated by industry and formalized by the IBPSA-USA Advocacy Committee (<a href="https://www.ibpsa.us/committee/advocacy-committee"
        target="_blank">https://www.ibpsa.us/committee/advocacy-committee</a>) with needs of current users that depend on the OpenStudio Application for business needs.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Will the OpenStudio Application remain available throughout the transition?
        <ul style="padding-bottom:10px;"><li>Three OpenStudio SDK releases are planned during the transition period (April 2019, October 2019, April 2020).  Updates to and installers for the OpenStudio Application will be made available at each of these OpenStudio SDK releases.
        Source code and installers for the OpenStudio Application up to and including the April 2020 release will remain available after the transition period. </li></ul></li>
        <li>Who will the OpenStudio Application transition to?  Will the OpenStudio Application still be open-source/freeware after the transition? <ul style="padding-bottom:10px;"><li>The OpenStudio Application is currently licensed under a BSD 4-Clause open-source license.
        This license allows for any entity to fork the code for further development and distribution under a variety of licenses, open-source and otherwise.
        Currently, BTO and NREL are not considering transferring copyright of the OpenStudio Application or changing the open-source BSD 4-Clause license for code maintained by NREL before or during the transition period.
        NREL may explore licensing options for the use of the OpenStudio trademark or other assets by interested third-party developers and distributors upon request.  Given the recent timing of this announcement, no entity or entities have yet announced specific plans to continue support for the OpenStudio Application after the transition period.
        Any entities interested in potentially supporting or maintaining the OpenStudio Application should contact <a href="mailto:openstudio@nrel.gov">OpenStudio@nrel.gov</a> with any questions. </li></ul></li>
        <li>How can I be involved in this or other changes to OpenStudio in the future? <ul style="padding-bottom:10px;"><li>For future significant changes, BTO aims to gather broad stakeholder feedback before finalizing decisions. More information will be provided at a relevant time.</li></ul></li></ul>`

        It has been packaged as an Electron desktop application and leverages OpenStudio Server for improved robustness, scalability, and capability.
        This new version of PAT supports “algorithmic” workflows – methods for automatically generating large sets of analysis data points.
        Choose from Design Of Experiments, Latin Hypercube Sampling, multiple optimization methods, and more to identify the most sensitive parameters in a model, calibrate a model against real consumption data, or optimize a model to balance multiple design objectives.
        Algorithmic analyses tend to be computationally intensive, so the new PAT supports simulation on Amazon Web Service or other resources provisioned with OpenStudio Server. Complete release notes are available <a href="https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/releases/tag/v2.1.0">here</a>.`

        <br/>Within EnergyPlus, advanced building controls are typically implemented utilizing the EnergyManagementSystem (EMS) suite of objects.
        This involves defining Sensors and Actuators that interact with building parameters through Programs which are written in the EnergyPlus Runtime Language (ERL).
        With the creation and larger adoption of OpenStudio Measures, the desire to simulate advanced building and grid interaction related control strategies has only increased.
        To facilitate those efforts, the EMS objects have been wrapped in both the forward and reverse translators. The model objects are:<br/>
        <br/>•\tEnergyManagementSystemActuator
        <br/>•\tEnergyManagementSystemConstructionIndexVariable\
        <br/>•\tEnergyManagementSystemCurveOrTableIndexVariable
        <br/>•\tEnergyManagementSystemGlobalVariable
        <br/>•\tEnergyManagementSystemInternalVariable
        <br/>•\tEnergyManagementSystemMeteredOutputVariable
        <br/>•\tEnergyManagementSystemOutputVariable
        <br/>•\tEnergyManagementSystemProgram
        <br/>•\tEnergyManagementSystemProgramCallingManager
        <br/>•\tEnergyManagementSystemSensor
        <br/>•\tEnergyManagementSystemSubroutine
        <br/>•\tEnergyManagementSystemTrendVariable
        <br/>•\tOutputEnergyManagementSystem<br/>
        <br/>Currently the interface to include EMS into an OSM is strictly Measure based.  Adding these Objects to the GUI in the OS Application is currently being scoped for the upcoming fiscal year, however it is funding dependent.<br/>
        <br/>In the OSM file, most EMS objects will attach directly to Model objects thru their Handles or UIDs.
        Upon EnergyPlus translation, those UIDs are replaced with Object names. While most Objects have restricted parameters, Programs and Subroutines can either be defined line by line thru the Measure API or all at once by defining a large string block.<br/>
        <br/>Also, all EMS objects reverse translate so if there are large legacy IDF models, the user can use this to at least get a start on what the new OSM would look like.  One caveat is that when a referenced object exists that won’t reverse translate,
        OpenStudio will still translate the EMS object, but leave the referenced field blank and a warning message is thrown.
        The name of the object that didn’t translate is put in a comment above the EMS object so that the user can go find it in the IDF and manually figure out how to connect it up in the new OSM.<br/>
        <br/>In addition to the aforementioned EMS functionality, the following OpenStudio capability was implemented:<br/>
        <br/>•\tAdded BuildingUnit class for grouping Spaces into logical units
        <br/>•\tUpdated template OpenStudio Measures to work with OpenStudio 1.x and 2.x
        <br/>•\tAdded fuel type to OtherEquipment and CoilHeatingGas
        <br/>•\tEnforce lowercase names in runner.registerValue

        <br/>Generating code baseline models (aka Appendix G, LEED, Performance Rating Method) is a big part of an energy modeler's job because many things (LEED certification, utility incentives, etc.) are based on the difference between the proposed and baseline model.
        Historically, this process has been performed largely by hand, leaving room for errors in manual data entry or interpretation of the modeling requirements.  These errors cause delays and cost money because, when identified, they must be corrected by the modeler.
        In an effort to reduce the time modelers spend on this process (and free them up for more design work), the OpenStudio team has automated this baseline model generation process via a Measure, which will be available on BCL.
        This Measure modifies the envelope, loads, HVAC efficiencies, controls, etc. in the proposed model to transform it into the baseline.  While it may not cover all situations (specific limitations are listed when the Measure is run), it is expected to work for a large majority of projects.
        Because the result is an OpenStudio model, anything not covered by the Measure can be modified by hand.  This Measure was funded by Xcel Energy’s Energy Design Assistance Program, and was based on previous work to create the DOE Prototype Buildings.<br/>
        <br/>OpenStudio is now a Level 2 certified gbXML authoring tool, http://gbxml.org/OpenStudioCertification_Latest. A variety of enhancements and bug fixes were made to support the certification effort, see the full changelog for details.<br/>
        <br/>The OS:Meter object has been renamed to OS:Output:Meter, the Meter class name remains supported in Ruby bindings but users are encouraged to move to the new name OutputMeter.<br/>
        <br/>The following OpenStudio Model objects were added

  html: `OpenStudio 1.9.0 is now available for download from the OpenStudio website.<br/>
        <br/>Notable new features include:<br/>
        <br/>- The addition of a substantial number of new HVAC features. Among the new features are three entirely new categories of HVAC capability beyond the routine component additions.
        The first new category is a family of availability managers that allow for detailed control over the air system period of operation.
        With these new availability managers, it is possible to have detailed control over night cycling, night ventilation, optimum morning start, temperature-based on/off and more.
        The second new category of HVAC capability included in this release is another family of control related inputs known as plant operation schemes.
        With plant operation schemes, it is possible to control the sequencing of plant system supply components relative to one another while considering ambient conditions.
        Third, OpenStudio has added support for dual duct air based systems.
        <br/>- A number of enhancements in areas beyond HVAC capability particularly to the OpenStudio application and the Measure ecosystem.
        <br/>- A number of bug fixes and performance improvements.<br/>

The Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT) lets users modify a baseline OpenStudio model using OpenStudio measures to produce design alternatives.</p>
        <p>OpenStudio measures are specially formatted Ruby scripts and accompanying files for modifying energy models in OpenStudio or EnergyPlus format.
        A small library of measures is included in the installer; more measures are available for download from the <a href="https://bcl.nrel.gov/">Building Component Library</a>, and users can create their own measures by following the <a href="http://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/measures/measure_writing_guide/">Measure Writing Guide</a>.
        In PAT, modifications to the baseline energy model are specified by selecting a measure and setting its argument values.
        Mutually exclusive choices (e.g. alternative values of the South fa&ccedil;ade window-to-wall ratio) are typically placed in a measure group to ensure that a design alternative&rsquo;s measures do not conflict with or overwrite each other.
        Design alternatives are specified by choosing 0-1 measures from each group. Users can debug their measures and other simulation steps by reviewing the detailed information on the simulation run tab.
        Upon successful simulation, summary energy metrics for each design alternative are reported on the results tab, where the final models may also be opened in the OpenStudio Application.</p>

  html: `<p>Wed 8/24/2011&nbsp; &nbsp;12:00pm (PT) / 1:00pm (MT) / 2:00pm (CT) / 3:00pm (ET)</p>
        <p>Are you curious about the newest free open-platform software product developed by NREL and DOE?
        OpenStudio&#39;s objective is to help design more energy efficient buildings, using an application suite that provides the tools needed to create energy models.
        OpenStudio has two distinct components: the Application Suite and the Software Development Platform.
        The focus of this talk will be on the application suite which is primarily used by architects, engineers and others involved in the design, construction, or facility management industries.
        This includes building and home owners who are considering retrofits to existing structures or design options for new construction.</p>
