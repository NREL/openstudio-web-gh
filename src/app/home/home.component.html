    <p>OpenStudio<sup>®</sup> is a cross-platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux) collection of software tools to support whole building energy modeling using EnergyPlus and advanced daylight analysis using Radiance.  OpenStudio is an open source project to facilitate community development, extension, and private sector adoption. </p>

    <p><a href="http://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio">OpenStudio SDK</a> is both a Software Development Kit (SDK) and a Command Line Interface (CLI).
    Conceptually, OpenStudio SDK provides an Application Programming Interface (API) to access the
    EnergyPlus modeling engine. This interface provides many benefits such as a stable, version-controlled
    interface, space typology abstractions that make it easier for end-users to model buildings, and language
    bindings in Ruby, Python and C-Sharp to make it more accessible to users familiar with these languages.
    The CLI is a powerful, cross-platform tool that allows users to run OpenStudio based workflows on
    supported architectures such as Linux, Windows and Mac.</p>

    <p>The graphical applications include the <a href="https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin">OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudioapplication">OpenStudio Application</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT">Parametric Analysis Tool</a>. The SketchUp Plug-in and the Openstudio Application are maintained by the <a href="https://openstudiocoalition.org">OpenStudio Coalition</a>, which was founded to maintain and develop these graphical applications for the building energy modeling community.  The SketchUp Plug-in is an extension to Trimble’s popular SketchUp 3D modeling tool that allows users to quickly create geometry needed for EnergyPlus.  Additionally, OpenStudio supports import of gbXML and IFC for geometry creation.  The OpenStudio Application is a fully featured graphical interface to OpenStudio models including envelope, loads, schedules, and HVAC. ResultsViewer enables browsing, plotting, and comparing simulation output data, especially time series.  The Parametric Analysis Tool enables studying the impact of applying multiple combinations of OpenStudio Measures to a base model as well as export of the analysis results for EDAPT submission.</p>

    <p>OpenStudio Measure is a scripting facility that uses Ruby (and now phase 1 support for Python in v3.5.0)
    to automate model queries and transformations and to incrementally extend and customize the
    OpenStudio platform. To date, hundreds of Measures have been written and posted on the Building
    Component Library (BCL) (https://bcl.nrel.gov/), an open online database of OpenStudio related content
    like weather files, construction and equipment specifications. These Measures perform transformations
    that correspond to energy conservation measures—that’s the origin of the name—that range from
    simple lighting power density reductions to complex and context sensitive daylighting transformations,
    create custom reports, and link energy simulation to other analyses.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-standards">OpenStudio Standards</a> is a collection of Measures and resources that automate the construction of
    prototype building models (e.g., office, hospital, primary school) as well as the transformations
    associated with ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Appendix G “Performance Rating Method”, a commonly
    exercised transformation that supports code compliance, LEED certification, and utility incentive
    calculations.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-server">OpenStudio Server</a> allows vendors and users to combine seed models—either prototypical or specific—
    with Measures in a large-scale computing environment to specify and organize large scale analyses such
    as uncertainty analysis, model calibration, design optimization, or stock level measure analysis, all via
    the OpenStudio Analysis Framework (OSAF) quickly and systematically. The transparency of the
    OpenStudio platform is requisite for applications that support taxpayer and ratepayer funded programs.</p>

    <p>OpenStudio allows building researchers and software developers to quickly get started through its multiple entry levels, including access through C++, Ruby, Python and C#. Users can leverage the Ruby interface to create OpenStudio Measures that can be easily shared and applied to OpenStudio Models.</p>
